For his performance of ‘Jupiter’ in Handel’s <span class="italic">Semele</span> with Conductor Jeffrey Thomas and the American Bach Soloists, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: “That the dealings between Semele and Jupiter landed with emotional force was due to the strong performances by soprano Arwen Myers and tenor Chase Henry Hopkins, both of whom delivered their assignments with tenderness and gusto… Hopkins’ elegant phrasing – especially in the famous “Where’er you walk” – conjured up an image of Jupiter as a suave seducer” (The San Francisco Chronicle).</p>
