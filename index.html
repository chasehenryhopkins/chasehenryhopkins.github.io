          <p class="photocaption">Haymarket Opera Company enriches the musical community of Chicago and the Midwest with performances of 17th- and 18th-century music.</p>
          <p>Founded by Artistic Director Craig Trompeter, HOC is a fixture of the Chicago classical music scene and is swiftly becoming a leader of historically inspired 17th and 18th century opera. Haymarket has been praised in the New York Times for it's "finely played, carefully sung, lovingly detailed period performance" and continues to surprise and delight audiences with rarely performed works from the Baroque and Classical period. Passionate about this repertoire, Hopkins joins Haymarket brining relevant experience as a performer and Artistic Director at Opera Edwardsville.</p>

          <p>Conducted by Jeffrey Thomas.</p>
          <p>The 9th annual American Bach Soloists Festival will take place 3–12 August 2018 in San Francisco, California. Each summer festival focuses on a different aspect of the world of Baroque music, and for 2018, ABS Artistic Director Jeffrey Thomas has chosen the music of Germany with a particular emphasis on "The Glorious Court of Dresden," known for the extraordinary quality of music that was composed for the electors and kings of Saxony who upheld the highest artistic and cultural standards for their subjects. Its splendid Baroque and Rococo architecture brought the city its nickname as the “Jewel Box,” and a distinguished roster of performers and composers made it one of Europe’s most important musical capitals. A full array of free events — including public master classes, lectures, concerts, and colloquia — complement the performances by American Bach Soloists in two exceptionally fine venues.</p>
          <p>Large-scale opera and oratorio is a major component of every American Bach Soloists' Summer Festival. Based on an English opera libretto yet designated “after the manner of an Oratorio,” Handel’s 'Semele' melds the two forms into one superb work.</p>
          <p>Reviews:</p>
          <p class="reviewsindent">"That the dealings between Semele and Jupiter landed with emotional force was due to the strong performances by soprano Arwen Myers and tenor Chase Henry Hopkins, both of whom delivered their assignments with tenderness and gusto… Hopkins’ elegant phrasing – especially in the famous “Where’er you walk” – conjured up an image of Jupiter as a suave seducer”" &mdash; SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE</p>

          <p>American tenor, Chase Henry Hopkins has been described as a “strong and convincing presence” (Opera Today) and praised for delivering “thoughtful and disciplined” performances (Operawire). For his performance of ‘Jupiter’ in Handel’s <span class="italic">Semele</span> with Conductor Jeffrey Thomas and the American Bach Soloists, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: “That the dealings between Semele and Jupiter landed with emotional force was due to the strong performances by soprano Arwen Myers and tenor Chase Henry Hopkins, both of whom delivered their assignments with tenderness and gusto… Hopkins’ elegant phrasing – especially in the famous “Where’er you walk” – conjured up an image of Jupiter as a suave seducer” (The San Francisco Chronicle).</p>
